# AI Case Study - NVIDIA 

### Where does NVIDIA's story begin?

NVIDIA was founded in April 1993 by Jen-Hsun Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Penn. At the time, NVIDIA was a risky venture, as it was focused on GPU technology, especially in the computer gaming sector. The tech industry was just starting to understand the power of CPUs, and the founders developed the idea behind the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). After undergoing countless challenges, they released several revolutionary products. 
 
The company started with a mere $40,000 in starting capital, and then received an initial investment of $20 million in venture capital funding from Don Valentine at Sequoia Capital. NVIDIA released their IPO in 1999.

With products like RIVA 228 and GeForce 256, NVIDIA was a company focused heavily on the video game market. With the development of CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architechture), the focus of the company was shifting. CUDA was a foundational building block in growing NVIDIA's success in AI technology to what it is today. CUDA was integrated into NVIDIA's GPUs and and thus created the tools for software developers to use in various AI applications.

### NVIDIA's Approach to Delving in the AI World

NVIDIA was a prioneer in its GPU technology, and starting from as early as 2007, has been transitioning its focus from gaming to AI application. The best example of this would be OpenAI. ChatGPT and OpenAI would not have made such an impact if it wasn't for the supercomputer that NVIDIA provided, using 10,000 NVIDIA GPUs.

NVIDIA's primary targeted customer is the classic software developer looking to use a seamless and powerful hardware. In 2023, 70% of the AI chips used in the market are produced by NVIDIA. Companies, big and small, have been using NVIDIA's hardware to accomplish their goals. Tech giants such as Miscrosoft, Google, and Facebook get their supply of GPUs from NVIDIA. 

The sheer power and quantity of NVIDIA's GPUs is what makes them so far ahead of their competition. Jen-Hsun Huang had a vision of how vital AI would be in the coming future, and his nature of diving into the unknown paid off. In the early 2010s, neural nets started to become a little more useful and powerful, providing meaningful results. NVIDIA used its GPUs to train these neural nets much faster than traditional CPUs. Since the focus on NVIDIA's GPUs has been efficiency, processing power, it is a key characteristic that made it stand out from any competition.

The crux of NVIDIA's success in AI has been the inclusion of CUDA and the progress of neural nets. Specific NVIDIA AI products include: A and H series, Tegra series, Mellanox ConnectX SmartNICs, Quantum InfiniBand, AI Enterprise, and Drive. To separate them into their fields:
* **A and H series, DGX systems, Quantam InifinBand, and SmartNICs** are used for data center applications and cloud computing.
* **Drive** is specifically used for self-driving car applications
* **Tegra** is used for smaller devices, such as smartphones and handheld electronics
* **AI Enterprise** is meant for software developers to use NVIDIA's powerful GPUs

### NVIDIA's Competitors

As stated before, while NVIDIA is still producing products in their GeForce line for gaming, they have now become the established source for the best quailty GPUs used in AI. Their main standing is in hardware, and with its early intervention into the field, NVIDIA has the headstart. Since AI is a fairly new field, most companies in AI hardware have been focused on building their products to be as fast and powerful as possible.

Although NVIDIA has over 70% of the market share in AI chips, there are many competitors, though they are years behind NVIDIA's progress. For example, Intel and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) are trying to establish a presence in AI hardware. AMD is going through a similar path as NVIDIA, with making GPUs for gaming, and adapting them for AI. Microsoft is currently their biggest client, using their GPUs for Azure and Copilot. Intel is prodcing their own AI accelator, Gaudi 3, however they are estimated to have less than 1% of the market share.

### The Success Story of NVIDIA

NVIDIA has been growing drastically since its inception. However, the biggest jump that the company has seen was when ChatGPT and OpenAi exploded in late 2022. NVIDIA is currently the third most valuable company in the world. In terms of company value, NVIDIA is worth $2.9 trillion! A commonly used metric for technology companies is DCFs (discounted cash flow), however for mature companies, using earning multiples which could result in a more accurate value for future value. As expected, NVIDIA is ourperforming its competitors by a huge margin. For example in Q1 2023, while NVIDIA's business grew by 14%, AMD did not grow, and Intel decreased by 39%. Many may argue that luck played a role in NVIDIA's success, but it is actually Jen-hsen Huang's philosophy that really drove. He famously said,
> “Our company is thirty days from going out of business.”

This was actually true closer to the beginning of the NVIDIA's inception, when the company was running out of funding. The mindset has not changed since then. NVIDIA takes on big risks in every endeavor it explores. When it came to AI development, it was a very big risk at the time to invest so much time and money into something so unknown. At the time, there was very little profit to be had, but the focus never shifted. It is very clear how much this risk paid off now! 

### The Future

Thus far, the focus for NVIDIA has been the quality of their products. They famously have the most powerful hardware available, so much so that the majority of the world prefers to use their products for AI. It is definitely possible for NVIDIA to create applications themselves, utilizing their own AI tools. A current example of them implementing this is Omniverse, a platform for metaverse applications, focused on the industrial side. However, as knowledge of the AI space grows, inevitably there will be more and more regulation surrounding this field. Instead of treating this as a hurdle, I think that creating some sort of system in the cybersecurity sector could be extremely beneficial. As NVIDIA is the one producing the hardware and is responsible for developing such powerful AI accelarants, it would be a great complement to have a product that can control it as well. As NVIDIA has the majority market share of AI chips in the world, it has the advantage of providing the best information on them, which would be essential in making this product possible. In whichever shape it takes form, likely a software, it would utilize already built-in features that NVIDIA's GPUs use. This product would require a lot of research, and likely utilize applications that have used NVIDIA's hardware. In other words, to counter NVIDIA's technology, you would need it itself. The primary reason why such a product could succeed is because of how the general public feels about AI. It is such an unknown, yet powerful technology, that it is easy to assume many would be overwhelmed, even fearful of the endless possibilities. The idea wouldn't be to less the capabilities, instead to control them.
